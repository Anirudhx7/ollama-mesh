> **[Try the live demo](https://anirudh.social/marbor/demo/)** - see the real admin dashboard (read-only) with live cluster telemetry, VRAM state, and request logs. No install required.

## Quick Start

### Try it in 5 minutes (No GPU/Ollama required)

Experience the complete gateway and monitoring stack locally in 5 minutes using mock backends:

1. **Clone and start the demo stack**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anirudhx7/marbor && cd marbor
   make demo
   ```
   This spins up `marbor`, two mock Ollama backend nodes, Prometheus, and Grafana, then runs a 20-request benchmark to generate live telemetry.

2. **Access the dashboards**:
   * **Marbor Dashboard**: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (Credentials: `admin` / `admin`)
   * **Grafana Telemetry**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (Pre-configured dashboard included)

3. **Run a manual benchmark**:
   Test the cold-vs-warm latency gap through the marbor proxy:
   ```bash
   go run ./cmd/bench -endpoint http://localhost:11434
   ```

4. **Clean up**:
   ```bash
   make demo-down
   ```

---

### Quick Installer (Linux & macOS)

*   **Install only**
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL raw.githubusercontent.com/Anirudhx7/marbor/main/install.sh | sh
    ```
    Downloads the official matching binary for your platform (`linux`/`darwin` and `amd64`/`arm64`) and installs it to `/usr/local/bin`. Run `marbor` manually to start. If a version is already installed, this reports old → new instead of upgrading silently.

*   **Quick demo - Auto-Discover & Run in background**
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL raw.githubusercontent.com/Anirudhx7/marbor/main/install.sh | START=1 sh
    ```
    Installs the binary, starts the gateway in the background against a fresh `marbor.db`, and prints operational access details. Before starting, it scans the local physical network subnet (and localhost) for active GPU backends (Ollama, vLLM, TGI, and llama.cpp) and interactively prompts you to pick which discovered nodes to seed into `marbor.db` (comma-separated numbers, `all`, or `skip`) - there's no config file to hand-edit. This starts a plain background process (`nohup`) - it won't survive a reboot, so treat this as a way to try marbor, not run it long-term. After starting, the installer verifies the proxy, admin dashboard, and metrics endpoints are actually responding (not just that the process exists) and prints diagnostics if anything's off. Re-running this command while an instance is already running won't spawn a duplicate - it detects the existing process and re-verifies its health instead.

*   **Production - Auto-Discover & Run as a managed service (recommended for real deployments)**
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL raw.githubusercontent.com/Anirudhx7/marbor/main/install.sh | SERVICE=1 sh
    ```
    Same as the quick-demo command (including the interactive node-discovery prompt), but instead of a background process it installs and enables a proper OS service (`Restart=on-failure`, starts on boot) - this is what you want for anything you intend to keep running. Currently implemented via `systemd` on Linux (requires root/sudo; logs via `journalctl -u marbor -f`). `SERVICE=1` is deliberately OS-agnostic - on macOS or any host without a supported service manager, it prints a notice and falls back to the same background mode as the quick-demo command rather than failing the install.

### Uninstalling

```bash
curl -fsSL raw.githubusercontent.com/Anirudhx7/marbor/main/uninstall.sh | sh
```

Run this from the same directory `install.sh` was run in (it looks for `marbor.db` and the pidfile there). It stops and removes the systemd service or background process and removes the binary. `marbor.db` is always kept by default when piped like this (stdin isn't a terminal, so the keep/remove prompt never runs) - pass `KEEP_DB=0` to remove it instead:

```bash
curl -fsSL raw.githubusercontent.com/Anirudhx7/marbor/main/uninstall.sh | KEEP_DB=0 sh
```

To get the interactive `Keep SQLite database? [Y/n]` prompt instead of relying on the env vars, download the script first so it runs with a real terminal attached: `curl -fsSL .../uninstall.sh -o uninstall.sh && sh uninstall.sh`.

---

### Docker Compose (Production Deployment)

Run a production-ready gateway, optionally with the metrics stack scraping the proxy:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anirudhx7/marbor && cd marbor
docker compose up -d                                                        # gateway only
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.monitoring.yml up -d # gateway + Prometheus + Grafana
```
This starts:
* **Marbor** ([http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)): Main gateway container.
* **Prometheus** (with the monitoring overlay): Automatically scraping the Marbor metrics endpoint.
* **Grafana** (with the monitoring overlay, [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)): Pre-provisioned with the official [Marbor dashboard](grafana/marbor.json).

## The Problem: Uncontrolled LLM Cloud Spend at Scale

Enterprise teams deploying LLM-powered applications - coding agents, RAG pipelines, internal copilots - face a compounding cost problem:

- **Cold-start latency tax.** Generic load balancers spray requests across GPU nodes with no awareness of model residency. Each miss triggers a 15-45 second model load from disk to VRAM, destroying time-to-first-token (TTFT) SLAs.
- **Invisible cloud egress.** Without a local-first routing layer, traffic silently overflows to OpenAI/Anthropic at $0.15-$60/M tokens. Platform teams discover the bill at month-end.
- **No GPU utilization visibility.** Ops teams have Grafana for CPU and memory. They have nothing for per-node VRAM residency, model warm state, or inference cost attribution across API keys.

**Marbor eliminates all three.** It sits between your applications and your GPU fleet, routing every request to the node that already has the model loaded in VRAM. Cloud overflow is explicit, metered, and off by default. Every token is counted, attributed to an API key, and valued against your configured cloud reference rate.

## Enterprise Feature Matrix

| Category | Feature | Detail |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **GPU-Aware Routing** | Warm-first model routing | Polls `/api/ps` on every node every 2s. Routes to the node where the model is already resident in VRAM. Eliminates cold-start latency. |
| | VRAM-fit placement | Cold requests route to the node with the most free VRAM. Prevents OOM under concurrent multi-model traffic. |
| | Deployment-aware GPU-count placement | Nodes declare tensor/pipeline/expert/data-parallel width (or one-click "Adopt" what the marbor agent auto-detects). A model needing 8 GPUs for tensor-parallel inference can no longer be routed to a 4-GPU node - the scheduler gates on GPU count, not just VRAM. |
| | Session affinity (KV-cache) | `X-Session-ID` header pins a conversation to a node. KV-cache stays hot - subsequent turns skip re-prefill. TTL-based eviction. |
| | Proactive model warmup | `keep_alive` pings on a configurable schedule keep priority models resident between requests. |
| **Financial Controls** | Real-time savings tracking | Every locally-served token valued against your cloud reference rate. Dashboard shows exact dollar savings vs pure-cloud baseline. |
| | Per-key cost attribution | Token totals and estimated cost per API key per month. Attribute inference spend to teams, projects, or agents. |
| | Cloud spend metering | Overflow tokens priced at provider-configured rates. Full local-vs-cloud cost breakdown. |
| | Per-key quotas | Hard `daily_limit`/`monthly_limit` per key. 429 when exceeded. Persisted across restarts. |
| **Multi-Tenant Auth** | Per-key rate limiting | Token-bucket rate limiter per API key. `X-RateLimit-Limit/Remaining/Reset` headers on every response. |
| | Model allow-lists | Per-key model restrictions. 403 on unauthorized model access - enforced at the control plane, not advisory. |
| | Key expiration | `expires_at` per key. Automatic invalidation. No manual rotation under pressure. |
| **Observability** | Prometheus metrics | 20 production metrics: request throughput and TTFT, latency percentiles, active connections, token counts, cache hit/miss, retry rates, cloud fallback frequency, local model degradation, quota rejections, request queue depth/timeouts, warmup pings and residency, schedule fires, model evictions, prewarming accuracy, panic recovery, node health. |
| | Grafana dashboard | Included JSON ([`grafana/marbor.json`](grafana/marbor.json)). One-click import. Request throughput and error rate, latency percentiles, warm-routing hit ratio, connections per node, tokens/s by key. |
| | Structured logging | `--log-format json` for Loki, Datadog, Fluentd, Splunk. Per-request access log with key name, model, node, status, latency, request ID. |
| | Audit trail | Append-only audit trail persisted in SQLite (`audit_log`). Every request recorded with crypto/rand request IDs. |
| | Webhook alerts | `node_down`/`node_up` and `agent_down`/`agent_up` (marbor agent reachability) events with HMAC-SHA256 signatures. PagerDuty/OpsGenie/Slack-ready. |
| **Resilience** | Automatic retry/failover | Dead node before first byte triggers retry on alternate healthy nodes → cloud → 502. Transparent to the client. |
| | Request queue | Configurable `queue_max_depth` and `queue_timeout_ms`. Traffic spikes queue and drain rather than immediately 502-ing. |
| | Per-node in-flight cap | Optional `max_in_flight_per_node` (global) with a per-node override. A node at/over its cap is excluded from routing - failover/cloud/503 - instead of queued, for operators who need overflow rather than piling onto a slow node. Best-effort (approximate under a concurrent request burst), not an atomic guarantee. |
| | Node drain | `POST /admin/nodes/{name}/drain` marks a node so the router skips it for new requests while in-flight work completes. Zero-downtime GPU maintenance. |
| | Config hot-reload | `SIGHUP` or `POST /admin/v1/config/reload` re-syncs state from `marbor.db` in place. Key rotations and routing changes take effect without dropping connections. |
| **Cluster Telemetry** | Cluster-wide VRAM | Per-node used-VRAM live across the entire cluster from each node's own `/api/ps`. No sidecar agent required. |
| | GPU metrics | nvidia-smi integration on marbor host: temperature, power draw, total capacity. Remote nodes: real telemetry via the optional marbor agent, or operator-declared `vram_total_mb` if it is not installed. Every figure labelled with its source (nvidia/api/declared/agent). |
| | VRAM fit indicators | Green/yellow/red badges per model per node. Ops teams see at a glance whether a model fits in available VRAM. |
| **Multi-Backend** | Ollama, vLLM, TGI, llama.cpp, MLX | Declare `runtime: ollama/vllm/tgi/llamacpp/mlx` per node. The router is runtime-agnostic; health probes and model-list calls use the correct API per runtime. |
| | Path-aware routing | `/api/*` routes to Ollama nodes only. `/v1/*` routes to any runtime. Non-Ollama nodes are transparent to OpenAI SDK clients. |
| **Deployment** | Single binary | One static Go binary per platform. Drop onto a VM and run. No package manager, no virtualenv, no container runtime required. |
| | Docker auto-discovery | Scans Docker socket for `ollama/ollama` containers. Auto-registers nodes. Zero config. |
| | Cloud format translation | Ollama-native requests that overflow to cloud get OpenAI responses translated back to Ollama NDJSON. Clients never see a format difference. |

---

## TTFT Performance: The Business Case

The single most impactful metric for LLM infrastructure is **Time-to-First-Token (TTFT)**. Every cold model load adds tens of seconds of latency before the first token appears. In a multi-agent workflow making hundreds of calls per hour, this compounds into minutes of wasted wall-clock time per pipeline execution.

Marbor's warm-first routing avoids this: the router knows which models are resident in VRAM on which nodes at sub-3-second granularity and sends each request to a node that already has the model loaded.

### Measured numbers (real hardware, not estimates)

Measured through a deployed Marbor v0.13.1 instance routing to a single consumer-GPU
Ollama node, using the harnesses in [`bench/`](bench/). Model: an 8B-parameter Q4_K_M model
(~9.6 GB on disk). Cold = model evicted from VRAM before each request; warm = model
already resident.

| Scenario (via Marbor) | n | p50 TTFT | min | max |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cold (model must load from disk) | 3 | **17.3 s** | 11.5 s | 18.1 s |
| Warm (model resident) | 10 | **8.1 s** | 1.9 s | 13.8 s |

Fastest warm sample observed through Marbor: **0.4 s** - a 43× improvement over the
median cold start.

Honest context for these numbers: on the benchmark node only ~3.3 GB of the model's
~10.6 GB runtime footprint fit in VRAM, so even "warm" first-token latency was partly
CPU-bound and jittery. On a node where the model fully fits in VRAM, the warm path is
the GPU's native prompt-eval speed and the cold-vs-warm gap widens further. A control
run direct-to-node (bypassing Marbor) showed the same warm-latency profile, i.e. the
Marbor's proxy overhead is negligible. Reproduce it on your own hardware with the
harness in [`bench/`](bench/).

---

## The Savings Angle

This is the dashboard screenshot that sells itself: Marbor tracks every token you served locally vs in the cloud, and shows you exactly how much that local inference saved compared to routing everything to OpenAI.

The math uses real parsed token counts from each response (`eval_count` from Ollama, `usage.total_tokens` from cloud), valued at your configured reference rate. When token data is unavailable, the dashboard shows "-" rather than a fabricated number. No fake math.

Platform engineers with a team routing through local GPU hardware typically see $200-$3,000+/month in avoided cloud spend visible in the dashboard within the first week. Full financial model: [SAVINGS-MATH.md](docs/SAVINGS-MATH.md).

---

## Supported Backends

Marbor is runtime-agnostic. Declare `runtime:` per node and the router uses the correct health probe and model-discovery call for each backend.

| Backend | `runtime:` value | Health check | Model discovery | Path routing |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Ollama | `ollama` (default) | GET /api/ps | /api/ps response | /api/* and /v1/* |
| vLLM | `vllm` | GET /health | GET /v1/models | /v1/* only |
| TGI (HuggingFace) | `tgi` | GET /health | GET /info | /v1/* only |
| llama.cpp server | `llamacpp` | GET /health | GET /v1/models | /v1/* only |
| MLX (`mlx_lm.server`, Apple Silicon) | `mlx` | GET /v1/models | GET /v1/models | /v1/* only |

`/api/*` paths (Ollama-native) route only to Ollama nodes. `/v1/*` paths route to any runtime - OpenAI SDK clients work unchanged against a mixed fleet.

**Adding nodes:** nodes are written straight to `marbor.db` from the admin dashboard's **GPU Nodes** page, or via one `POST /admin/nodes` call per node - repeat the call per backend (for whole-fleet registration use the [GPU node registration Ansible playbook](docs/deploy/gpu-node-registration.md) or `install.sh`'s network-discovery wizard):

```json
{
  "name": "vllm-gpu",
  "url": "http://10.0.1.20:8000",
  "runtime": "vllm",
  "vram_total_mb": 81920
}
```

## Configuration

There is no config file. Marbor is DB-first: everything lives in `marbor.db` (SQLite), and you configure it entirely through the admin dashboard or the REST API - nothing to hand-edit, nothing to redeploy for a settings change. Nodes, keys, quotas, and routing config live in that database, so they survive a reboot with no re-registration - see the [Production Deployment Guide](docs/PRODUCTION.md) for the systemd unit and Compose restart policy that keep the process itself running.

**First boot:**
```bash
./marbor              # or --db /path/to/marbor.db to pick the database location
```
The binary opens (or creates) `marbor.db`, starts blank-slate, and prints a banner pointing you at the dashboard. Log in at `http://localhost:8080` with `admin` / `admin` - you'll be forced to set a new password on first login.

**Secrets at rest:** cloud provider API keys, marbor-issued API keys, the LiteLLM key, HuggingFace token, and webhook secret are encrypted in `marbor.db` with AES-256-GCM. The encryption key lives in `marbor.db.key`, generated next to the database on first boot (0600 permissions) - back it up alongside `marbor.db`, since losing it means re-entering those secrets. To supply your own key instead (e.g. from a secrets manager), set `MARBOR_ENCRYPTION_KEY` to a base64-encoded 32-byte value before starting the binary; `marbor.db.key` is not created when this is set. Upgrading from an older version that stored these fields as plaintext encrypts them automatically on first boot - no manual migration step.

From there, everything is a dashboard page or an `/admin/v1/...` API call:

| Area | Where |
|---|---|
| GPU nodes | **GPU Nodes** page, or `install.sh`'s network-discovery wizard (`--seed-node` under the hood) |
| API keys, rate limits, model allow-lists, quotas | **API Keys** page |
| Routing strategy, timeouts, retries, session affinity, queueing, thermal watchdog | **Settings → Advanced Routing** |
| Cloud overflow providers (OpenAI/Anthropic), cost-per-1k, spend caps | **Settings → Cloud Providers** / **Cloud Spend Cap** |
| Docker auto-discovery, webhooks | **Settings** (dedicated cards for each) |
| Model warmup schedule | **Settings → Global Warmup**, or per-node in the **Warmup** page |
| Model context windows | **Settings → Model Context Windows** |
| Proxy/admin ports, CORS, access log | **Settings → Proxy Configuration** / **Admin & Security** |

Prefer scripting it? Every one of those pages is a thin wrapper over `GET/PUT /admin/v1/settings`, `/admin/v1/nodes`, `/admin/v1/keys`, and `/admin/v1/cloud/providers` - GitOps-style operators can drive the same REST API from an init job instead of clicking through the UI.

## How Routing Works

```
Request arrives at :11434
    │
    ▼
Auth middleware: Bearer token validation → rate limit → quota check → model allow-list
    │
    ▼
Request queue: absorbs traffic spikes (configurable depth + timeout)
    │
    ▼
Router: extract model name from JSON body
    │
    ├── X-Session-ID present + session affinity enabled?
    │   └── Yes → route to pinned node (KV-cache affinity)
    │
    ├── Model warm in VRAM on any node?
    │   └── Yes → route to warm node with least active connections
    │
    ├── All nodes healthy?
    │   └── Yes → VRAM-fit placement (most free VRAM) or least-connections fallback
    │
    └── All nodes busy/down?
        └── Cloud overflow → OpenAI/Anthropic → response format-translated → cost logged
```

The router polls `/api/ps` on each node every 2 seconds. State is real-time, not cached guesses.

**Config hot-reload:** `kill -HUP <pid>` or `POST /admin/v1/config/reload` re-syncs live routing/nodes/keys/cloud-providers from `marbor.db` without dropping connections. (Listen ports/addresses and a few other startup-only settings still need a restart - the dashboard flags which ones.)

---

## Model Warmup

Marbor proactively keeps priority models loaded in VRAM between requests. Without this, idle models get evicted and the next request pays the cold-start tax.

Configure it in the dashboard's **Settings → Global Warmup** card: enable it, set the interval (default every 5 minutes), and list your highest-traffic models. Per-node warmup overrides live on the **Warmup** page.

---

## Cloud Fallback Setup

Add a cloud overflow provider from the dashboard's **Settings → Cloud Providers** card, or via one `POST /admin/v1/cloud/providers` call per provider - providers are persisted to `marbor.db`:

```json
{
  "name": "openai-overflow",
  "provider": "openai",
  "base_url": "https://api.openai.com",
  "api_key": "sk-...",
  "default_model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "cost_per_1k_tokens": 0.00015,
  "enabled": true
}
```

Ollama-native (`/api/*`) requests that fall back to cloud get the OpenAI response translated back to Ollama NDJSON - clients never see a format difference.

Set `local_only: true` on an API key (`PATCH /admin/v1/keys/{name}`, or the API Keys page's edit modal) to forbid that key from ever reaching a cloud provider - a request that would otherwise fall back instead fails closed with a `503 local_only_blocked` error. Every request's local/cloud/blocked outcome is durably counted per key and per provider, readable via `GET /admin/v1/spill` or `marbor spill`, and shown on the Analytics page's Cloud Spill table.

## Operational Topology

| Port | Service | Auth |
|------|---------|------|
| `:11434` | Ollama-compatible endpoint - drop-in replacement | Per-key Bearer token |
| `:8080` | Admin dashboard + REST API | Admin token |
| `:9090` | Prometheus metrics | Unauthenticated (scrape target) |

## Marbor Agent

`marbor-agent` is an optional second binary installed on each GPU node: `install.sh ROLE=agent` for a single host, or the [agent enrollment Ansible playbook](docs/deploy/marbor-agent-enrollment.md) for mass enrollment - one inventory-driven run (`ansible/playbooks/install-marbor-agent.yml`) enrolls and installs the agent on every already-registered node at once, idempotently skipping any that are already enrolled and healthy. It serves `GET /v1/status` and `GET /metrics` on **`:9200`** (default) and is polled by marbor - clients never talk to it, and it contains no control-plane code, so a compromised agent host cannot start the gateway.

One agent covers an entire physical host: multiple runtimes on the same box (e.g. Ollama on `:11434` plus vLLM on `:8000`) share one enrollment instead of needing one per node. Its bearer tokens are scope-tiered (`readonly` / `operator` / `admin`), and its TLS certificate can be pinned TOFU-style for headless enrollment (`marbor nodes confirm-tls`).

The fleet runs without it - remote nodes fall back to operator-declared `vram_total_mb`, always labelled `declared`. What the agent adds:

| Capability | Without agent | With agent |
|---|---|---|
| Remote node telemetry | Declared capacity only, labelled `declared` | Live fan/temp/power/disk/CPU/RAM and per-model residency, labelled `agent` |
| Model pulls on nodes | Proxied through marbor's own HTTP client | Dispatched to the node, with your HuggingFace token injected for gated downloads |
| Runtime process control | Not available | Start/stop/restart/logs of the node's runtime via an accepted control driver (systemd unit, Docker container, launchd label, Windows service, or bare PID file) |
| Node health | Passive HTTP polling from marbor | On-demand active liveness probe (`marbor runtime health <node>`) |

---

## Admin API

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/admin/v1/nodes` | Node list: status, VRAM usage, active models, source labels |
| GET | `/admin/v1/keys` | API keys: usage stats, monthly cost, token totals |
| GET | `/admin/v1/metrics/savings` | Cost savings vs pure cloud - current process lifetime |
| GET | `/admin/v1/cloud/providers` | Cloud fallback providers: status, spend |
| GET | `/admin/v1/spill` | Per-key, per-provider local/cloud/blocked request counts |
| GET | `/health` | 200 OK when control plane is ready (unauthenticated, for LB health checks) |
| POST | `/admin/nodes/{name}/drain` | Drain node for maintenance |
| PATCH | `/admin/keys/{name}` | Mutate key rate limits, quotas, model allow-lists at runtime |
| PATCH | `/admin/nodes/{name}` | Override `vram_total_mb`, `gpu_model`, `gpu_indices` at runtime |
| POST | `/admin/v1/config/reload` | Re-sync live settings from `marbor.db` without SIGHUP |

## CLI

`marbor` is a single static binary that is two tools in one - the server and a thin CLI client
of the Admin API - selected by its first argument. The marbor agent is a separate binary,
`marbor-agent`, installed on each GPU node (see [marbor agent enrollment](docs/deploy/marbor-agent-enrollment.md)):

<!-- END CLI TABLE -->

> **Breaking change (beta, no migration shim):** the separate `marbor`/`marbor-cli` binary
> (`cmd/marbor`) has been merged into the main `marbor` binary above. There were no external
> users of the standalone CLI binary, so it was removed outright rather than kept as an alias.

The CLI subcommands never talk to a marbor agent directly - every command is exactly one Admin API
request:

```bash
marbor version                          # CLI version, plus server version if reachable
marbor status                           # health/uptime/node-count summary (GET /health)

marbor login                            # authenticate once (prompts interactively) ...
marbor nodes                            # ... then every other command works with zero flags
marbor whoami                           # who the CLI is currently authenticated as
marbor logout                           # remove the saved session

marbor node control probe gpu-03        # what control driver was auto-discovered
marbor node control accept gpu-03 --driver systemd --identifier ollama.service
marbor runtime restart gpu-03           # requires an accepted control driver first
```

Every command supports `--json` from day one - this is the actual compatibility contract for
scripts/CI/Ansible, not the human table output, which may change shape between releases. `--server`
(default `http://localhost:8080`, env `MARBOR_SERVER`) points at a different Admin API instance.

`nodes`, `models`, `node control probe|accept`, and `runtime start|stop|restart` require a session.
The recommended flow is `marbor login` once (interactively, or with
`--username`/`--password`) - the CLI persists the resulting session to a local file (`0600`, under
the OS user config dir) so every later command in that shell, in a fresh terminal, or across a
reboot works with zero flags until the session expires. For scripts/CI/containers where a
persisted file isn't wanted, pass credentials on every invocation instead:
`--username`/`--password` or `MARBOR_USERNAME`/`MARBOR_PASSWORD` (these always take priority over the
saved session). There is no `--token`/`MARBOR_TOKEN` flag - a bearer token passed as a CLI argument
or read from an env var would still be visible in shell history, `ps`/Task Manager, and
process-creation logging for the life of that process, so login/saved-session and
username+password are the only credential paths. `marbor whoami` reports the saved identity,
live-verified against the server; `marbor logout` deletes the saved file. `status` and
`version` never need auth (`GET /health` is unauthenticated).

**Shared Linux accounts are not recommended for administrative use.** The audit log records the
authenticated marbor user, not necessarily the individual human using a shared operating-system
account. If a shared account is unavoidable, prefer a per-shell `MARBOR_USERNAME`/`MARBOR_PASSWORD`
pair over the persisted session file (env vars are process-scoped and don't collide across
concurrent sessions on the same account; the saved file is one shared file). For production
environments, the recommended deployment is one Linux account per administrator and one marbor user
per administrator - this gives accurate audit attribution and isolated CLI sessions.

Exit codes: `0` success, `1` user/input error (bad flag, missing credentials, no control driver
accepted yet), `2` server/Admin API error (unreachable, 5xx, agent dispatch failure), `4`
authentication/authorization failure (401/403, including an expired or invalid saved session).

`runtime start|stop|restart <node>` only works once a control driver has been accepted for that
node (via `node control accept`, or the GPU Nodes page's "Runtime Control" panel) - marbor never
guesses which service manager controls a node's runtime process.

### Running the CLI against a container

The Docker image already contains the merged binary, so no image changes are needed to use the
CLI against a containerized marbor - run it inside the running container:

```bash
docker exec <container> marbor status
```

## Observability Stack

### Prometheus

20 metrics exported at `:9090/metrics`:

- `marbor_requests_total` - total proxied requests (labels: key_name, model, node, status)
- `marbor_request_duration_seconds` - histogram of request latency
- `marbor_request_ttft_seconds` - histogram of time-to-first-token
- `marbor_active_connections` - active connections per node
- `marbor_node_healthy` - health gauge per node (1=healthy, 0=unhealthy)
- `marbor_warmup_model_resident` - warmup-target model residency per model/node (1=warm, 0=cold)
- `marbor_schedule_fires_total` - scheduled actions fired (labels: action, node)
- `marbor_model_evictions_total` - models unloaded from VRAM to free headroom, per node
- `marbor_cache_hits_total` - warm-model cache hits
- `marbor_cache_misses_total` - cold-start cache misses
- `marbor_tokens_total` - tokens processed (labels: key_name, node)
- `marbor_retries_total` - upstream failover retries per node
- `marbor_cloud_fallbacks_total` - cloud overflow events per provider
- `marbor_local_degradation_total` - requests substituted to a declared local alternate (labels: from, to)
- `marbor_quota_rejections_total` - 429 quota enforcement events (labels: key_name, period)
- `marbor_panics_total` - recovered handler panics
- `marbor_queue_depth` - current request queue depth
- `marbor_queue_timeouts_total` - queued requests that timed out before getting a node
- `marbor_warmup_pings_total` - proactive keepalive pings per model/node
- `marbor_prediction_accuracy_ratio` - rolling prewarming prediction accuracy (0.0-1.0)

### Grafana

Import [`grafana/marbor.json`](grafana/marbor.json) into Grafana and point its Prometheus datasource at your Prometheus instance - which scrapes marbor's `:9090/metrics`. Pre-built panels: request throughput and error rate, latency percentiles, warm-routing hit ratio, active connections per node, healthy-node count, tokens/s by API key. Running the Docker monitoring overlay provisions the datasource and this dashboard automatically (see [Docker Compose](#docker-compose-production-deployment)).

### Structured Logging

`--log-format json` emits slog JSON objects that Loki, Datadog, Fluentd, and Splunk parse natively. Every request logged with: key name (never the key value), model, target node, HTTP status, latency, request ID.

| **Per-key cost attribution** | ✅ Tokens + USD per key per month | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Single binary, zero deps** | ✅ Go static binary | ❌ Python + deps | ✅ | ❌ SaaS |
| **Embedded dashboard** | ✅ React UI in the binary | Separate UI | ❌ | SaaS dashboard |
| **Prometheus + Grafana** | ✅ 20 metrics + included dashboard | ✅ | Partial | ❌ |
| **Local-first architecture** | ✅ GPU traffic never leaves your network | ❌ Cloud-centric | ✅ | ❌ |

### Use Marbor when:

- You have on-premises GPU hardware running Ollama, vLLM, TGI, llama.cpp, or MLX (Apple Silicon) and want to maximize utilization before paying for cloud tokens.
- You need per-key auth, rate limiting, cost attribution, and a usage dashboard without standing up a Python service.
- You need GPU-warm-first routing to eliminate cold-start latency in multi-agent workflows.
- You want cloud overflow that is explicitly opt-in - not a default that silently generates bills.
- You need a single static binary that ops teams can deploy and manage like any other Go service.

### Use LiteLLM instead when:

- You route primarily between cloud providers (Bedrock, Vertex, Cohere) and don't have on-premises GPU hardware.
- You are already invested in the LiteLLM ecosystem and don't need GPU-aware routing.
- You are comfortable with the Python operational footprint.
